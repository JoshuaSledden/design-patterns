<h1>Design Patterns</h1>
<p>This is a set of examples for many different design patterns I have been learning over the course of my time as a software engineer.
With each example I will attempt to give a basic demonstration of the pattern in action, as well as a brief outline of its purpose.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/JoshuaSledden/design-patterns/tree/master/strategy">Strategy Pattern</a></h3>
The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independantly from clients that use it.
